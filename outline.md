* Intro

I. basic steps for troubleshooting:
   A. verify bug
      1. logs (psa)
      2. make sure you can reproduce bug
        a. user error: maybe the documentation is the problem
	b. can't fix what you can't see
   B. write a test that fails
      1. why testing is important
      	 a. ensures everyone knows what the code is suppose to be doing
	 b. ensures the code works
	 c. faster development
	 d. ensures bugs do not come back
      2. why before writing code?
      	 a. make sure you can reproduce the bug
	 b. make sure you actually fix the bug
   C. Fix the bug

II. Dig into the code
   A. Understanding the code
      1. how code is organized
      2. understanding the stack
      3. what is the stacktrace
   B. the scientific method
   C. the debugger
      1. print
      2. the stack again

III. more tools
   A. Change things
   B. Pylint and other code checkers
   C. Search Engines
   D. Write everything down
   E. Take a break
   F. Ask for help
      1. checklist for writing that question.
      2. places to ask
