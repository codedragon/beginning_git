# Introduction to GIT
### An opionated guide

## Maria Mckinley
## Assisted by Franco Mattos Neto




# Outline
* <span style="background-color: #E3735B">Introduction to GIT</span>
* Demonstration of using GIT

Disclosure: This talk is about understanding how to use git, so I will not be going into
certain details, like installing git. I will have links for instructions and feel free
to ping me on slack later for help.

## Problems with the "system" in the cartoon:
* often not obvious which version contains which changes
* often not easy to "revert" changes
* often not clear who made what changes
* often not clear how to combine changes from different versions

## <span style="background-color: #C43415">Version control</span>
## is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
## <span style="background-color: #C43415">Version control systems</span>
## are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.




* Git keeps track of history
* Serves as a backup
* Assists you to create a system for easier collaboration
* Can be used to enforce standards




## Some definitions
* Repo (Repository): a collection of files and folders that make a body of work
* Git:  a tool for saving history along with the body of work
* GitHub/GitLab:  a repository copy that everyone can reach and use




## Some important concepts
* All contributers have their own repo copy, including GitHub/GitLab
* Contributers are responsible to keep local copy aligned with central
* The more contributer's copies diverge, the more painful syncing

## More Definitions
* Merge: Combine changes from more than one copy




## Let's talk about the computer file system for a moment

Git puts everything it needs to keep track of changes in a hidden directory called
.git in the root directory of each repository




## Installation: I like GitLab's instructions, but others are available
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/how_to_install_git/index.html
## Full, well laid out tutorial
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/tutorials/make_your_first_git_commit.html




## Tools I chose for this Demo
* Command line
* Editor: emacs
* Git Central Repo: GitLab

# Let's create a repo
* command line: <font size= "10">`git init` </font>

## How to set up ssh keys for authenticating - Highly recommended
### GitLab
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html
### Github
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh




## What's an origin?
* shorthand name for remote repo a project was cloned from
* default for further communication
* name is just a convention




## How do I see what is the origin?
`git remote -v`




### Workflow
* re-orient yourself to work
* see if others have made changes
* do your work
* decide on content for current change
* choose what will be in the change
* add a descriptive note to your change
* put your changes in the common repo so everyone sees your changes




### Workflow
* git status: re-orient yourself to work
* git pull: see if others have made changes *need network*
* do work
* git diff: tool to decide on content *optional* 
* git add: choose what's included
* git commit: add a descriptive note
* git push: add changes to the common repo *need network*




## What's a commit?
* one or more changes made to a repo
* a revision
* how the repo looks now that these changes have been made
* a snapshot of your repo at a moment in time




## Anatomy of a status response:
* which branch currently on: *On branch main*
* which branch following on remote, commits not pushed: *Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.*
  or *Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.*
* what files have changes that have been recorded in git: *Changes to be committed:*
* what files have changes not recorded in git: *Untracked files*
