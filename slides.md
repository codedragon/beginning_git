# Introduction to GIT
### An opionated guide

## Maria Mckinley
## Assisted by Franco Mattos Neto




#Outline
* Introduction to GIT
* Demonstration of using GIT

Disclosure: This talk is about understanding how to use git, so I will not be going into
certain details, like installing git. I will have links for instructions and feel free
to ping me on slack later for help.

##Git keeps track of history
##Serves as a backup
###(as long as you push your changes to at least one other machine)
##Can be used to enforce standards




##Some definitions
* Repo: repository, a collection of files and folders that make a body of work
* Git:  a tool for saving history along with the body of work
* Github/Gitlab:  a central repository copy that everyone can reach and use




##Some important concepts
* All contributers have their own repo copy, including Github/Gitlab
* Contributers are responsible for keeping local copy aligned with central
* The more contributer's copies diverge, the more painful syncing

Git puts everything it needs to keep track of changes in a hidden directory called
.git in the root directory of each repository




#Installation
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git




##Choices I made for this Demo
* Command line
* Editor: emacs
* Git Central Repo: Gitlab




#Let's create a repo




##How to set up ssh keys for authenticating - Highly recommended
##Gitlab
##https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html
##Github
##https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh




##What's a commit?
* one or more changes made to a repo
* a revision
* how the repo looks now that these changes have been made
* a snapshot of your repo at a moment in time
