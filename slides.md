##Git keeps track of history and serves as a backup
###(as long as you push your changes to at least one other machine)




##Some definitions
* Repo: repository, a collection of files and folders that make a body of work
* Git:  a tool for saving history along with the body of work
* Github/Gitlab:  a central repository that everyone can reach and use




#Some important concepts
* Goal is to have everyone's local repo the same, including Github/Gitlab
* Git keeps track of all history

Git puts everything it needs to keep track of changes in a hidden directory .git in each repository
